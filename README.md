# Hi, I'm Nadhira! 👋

I'm a first year graduate student in **Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences** at Columbia University, previously I work as a data analyst in [Traveloka](https://www.traveloka.com/en-en) and [OCBC](https://www.ocbc.com/business-banking). My interest focuses in the field of data analysis, causal inference, and field experimentation, particularly as tools for advancing research in development economics. You can get in touch with me via email [nah2181@columbia.edu](mailto:nah2181@columbia.edu) or at [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/azzahrandhr)

## Academic Interests

- **Causal inference and Field experiments** — understanding not just what works, but why and for whom.
- **Climate Economics**- specifically examining the intersection of environmental science and economics.
- **Poverty and Inequality** — social protection programs, targeting, and behavioral interventions

## Background

Before grad school, I work as data analyst where I:

- Designed and analyzed **A/B tests and experiments** for product optimization
- Built **causal inference models** for pricing optimization using uplift modeling
- Developed **fraud detection models** that reduced verification costs by 49% while maintaining precision
- Created automated data pipelines and dashboards serving cross-functional teams using Tableau and Looker
