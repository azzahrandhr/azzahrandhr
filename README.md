# Hi, I'm Nadhira! 👋

I'm a first year graduate student in **Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences** at Columbia University, previously I work as a data analyst in [Traveloka](https://www.traveloka.com/en-en) and [OCBC](https://www.ocbc.com/business-banking). My interest focuses in the field of data analysis, causal inference, and field experimentation, particularly as tools for advancing research in development economics. You can get in touch with me via email [nah2181@columbia.edu](mailto:nah2181@columbia.edu) or at [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/azzahrandhr)

## Research & Academic Interests

- **Causal inference and Field experiments** - Design and analysis of experiments to identify causal effects in real-world settings
- **Climate & Development** - Climate impacts on development economic indicators
- **Gender & Education** - Education interventions, gender equality, and human capital development

## Professional Background

Before grad school, I work as data analyst where I:

- Designed and analyzed **A/B tests and experiments** for product optimization
